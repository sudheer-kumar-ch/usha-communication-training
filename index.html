                                One I realized goal setting is not mere thinking about the goal achievement or action planning</p>
                                
                                <p>But it also involved breaking it into tiny actions, visualizing and believing in it.</p>
                                <p>Mindset change, skills and environmental changes are also taken into consideration.</p>
                                
                                <p>I am all geared up to put into action these principles and relook on the challenges I face while I am on the path and bear fruits for myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>One can apply this principles in any areas to achieve different goals, health, business, wealth, relationships etc.</p></div>

                                I too have been attending these sessions. They have helped me a lot. They have given boost to my lowered morale, built my confidence again. They uplift me to do something for myself. Manage my time effectively and productively.<br/>
                                She helps us with questions to reflect upon ourselves and look within. The Lagan workshop was one of the best.</p>
                                
                                <p>There definitely is some quality learning with Usha Sarda, that can’t be missed. Her style is simple, warm and polite. Her information and interpretation that she extracts as topics from books or movies for the workshops cannot be missed. They help in reflection, self-analysis. I do come out a bit wiser and motivated after each session.</p>
                                
                                <p>Looking forward for more such workshops. Such a joy and pleasure to be introduced to her. Much success to Usha. Your kindness and a willingness to help others is unique. Keep it going and don’t loose your style.</p></div>

                                She helps us with questions to reflect upon ourselves and look within. The Lagan workshop was one of the best.</p>
